										<p>A scalable business, at its most basic level, is one that a person can run without personally doing all the work. At a higher level, it’s a business model that has the potential to generate growth in revenues significantly faster than its expenses. An example of a scalable business is a social media company (e.g., Facebook) or an app-based company (e.g., Rovio Entertainment).</p>
